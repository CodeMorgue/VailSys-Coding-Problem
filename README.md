# Vail Systems - Software Engineer, Test, & Infrastructure II Coding Problem

## System Requirements
This program assumes that the target system has the Java programming language installed. The program can easily be run in VSCode using the 
following extensions:
- Language Support for Java by Red Hat
- Debugger for Java
- Test Runner for Java

The project may also be run using the IntelliJ IDE with the proper SDK installed.

## Running the Program
Open the project folder in VSCode (with necessary extensions) or IntelliJ, and run the 'Rotate.java' file using the debugger. The program will print instructions to the console as
well as accept user input. The files may also be compiled individually and run using ```bash
javac```.

## Running the Tests
With the 'Test Runner for Java' extension installed, navigate to the 'RotateTest.java' file. Tests can be run individually using the run buttons aligned
with each method declaration (shown below).
